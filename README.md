# Snake Game

In this small project, I tried to use the knowledge I gained during the development of the Minesweeper game. The aim has been to finish all the functionalities of the game in 1 day and to be able to play with it at the end.

The challenge was accomplished, but a few design changes and detailing has been done in the following 2 days.
