This is a small project, where I tried to use the knowledge I gained during the development of the Minesweeper game.
The aim was to finish with all the functionalities of the game in 1 day and to be able to play with it at the end. The challenge was accomplished, but a few design changes and detailing had to be done in the following 2 days.
